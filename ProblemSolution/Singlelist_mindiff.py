# Problem Statement: Minimum Difference Between Any Two Elements

# You are given an integer array nums.
# Find the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.

# Return the minimum difference.

# Input: nums = [4, 9, 1, 32, 13]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The closest pair is (4, 1) with difference = 3.


# Input: nums = [10, 20, 30, 40]
# Output: 10
# Explanation: Every pair has difference of at least 10.


# Input: nums = [5, 5, 5]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Same numbers â†’ difference is 0.
